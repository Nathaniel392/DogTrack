# 2085-jevois-vision-suite

A program for tracking computer vision targets in FRC. This project is a fork of 2073's Jevois vision programming. The intent of this project is to provide similar functionality to the original with a slightly modified methodology. 

Rather than the traditional HSV filtering approach, this program uses the Green-Red approach outlined here https://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/showthread.php?p=1713557#post1713557 as well as making changes to tuning and multiple target handling.
As outlined in the post this method allows the camera to be set with normal exposure settings and used as a driver aid when not being used for targeting. Full description and instruction on the use of this program is avaliable in the DogTrack_User_Guide.docx or at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eK0lyk8H78Q-bHuyL-pj8vpCWHs2kfV2jJgqM6kgW0I/edit?usp=sharing
